CodeBook for the output tideData.txt from the script in run_analysis.R:

Code Book:

The data given in the Features columns all represent the mean or standard deviation for the specific Subject (person), Activity, and Feature. There are 180 observations in all; six activities for every 30 of the Subjects.

Row number, column 1

Subject, column 2: The actual performer of the activity, one out of 30 persons, only labeled with a number 1-30

Activity: One of the six activities that were included in the test: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Then comes 66 different Features, calculated from the motion data recorded by the smartphone each subject carried while performing an activity. The Features start out with "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" and ends with "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()". All values in these columns are averages over the subject and the activity.

The following variables are included in the tidy data set:

"Subject" "Activity" "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "tBodyAcc-std()-X" "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean()-X" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z" "tGravityAcc-std()-X" "tGravityAcc-std()-Y" "tGravityAcc-std()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyGyro-mean()-X" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyro-std()-X" "tBodyGyro-std()-Y" "tBodyGyro-std()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyAccMag-mean()" "tBodyAccMag-std()" "tGravityAccMag-mean()" "tGravityAccMag-std()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "tBodyGyroMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroMag-std()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "fBodyAcc-std()-X" "fBodyAcc-std()-Y" "fBodyAcc-std()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "fBodyGyro-mean()-X" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "fBodyGyro-std()-X" "fBodyGyro-std()-Y" "fBodyGyro-std()-Z" "fBodyAccMag-mean()" "fBodyAccMag-std()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
